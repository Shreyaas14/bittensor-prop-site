Steps for running:


- Make sure you use bun--not npm, not yarn, bun. https://bun.sh/

- To run frontend,
-    cd frontend
-    bun install
-    npm run dev


- To run backend,
-   cd backend
-   bun install
-   ts-node server.ts (make sure you have ts-node installed as well)

- For the website to be fully functioning, both the frontend AND the backend have to be running. So have one terminal for the backend, one for the frontend.
- Make sure that you see "connected to MongoDB"--that's how the data will be shown in the frontend. Otherwise, it'll look empty.
- If you need to check MongoDB data, tell me and I'll give you my login. Give me your IP, and I'll whitelist it so you can access the MongoDB cluster.
