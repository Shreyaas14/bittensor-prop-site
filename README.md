Steps for running:


- Make sure you use bun--not npm, not yarn, bun. https://bun.sh/

- To run frontend for the first time, cd frontend (gets you into the directory), bun install (installs libs), npm run dev (runs frontend)
- afterwards, just do npm run dev


- To run frontend for the first time, cd backend (gets you into the directory), bun install (installs libs), ts-node server.ts (runs backend)
- afterwards, just do ts-node server.ts

- For the website to be fully functioning, both the frontend AND the backend have to be running. So have one terminal for the backend, one for the frontend.
- Make sure that you see "connected to MongoDB"--that's how the data will be shown in the frontend. Otherwise, it'll look empty.
- If you need to check MongoDB data, tell me and I'll give you my login. Give me your IP, and I'll whitelist it so you can access the MongoDB cluster.
